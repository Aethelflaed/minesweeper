# Conan

[Conan](https://conan.io/) is an "open source, decentralized and multi-platform package manager".

In other words, conan is used to handle the project's dependencies, so the project itself has both the information on what its dependencies are, and a way to retrieve and install them.

This permits to have different projects each using their own version of a specific dependency without having to manually specify install paths and then configuration in each project.
