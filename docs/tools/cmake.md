# CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) "is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software."

CMake offers platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generates native makefiles that can be used to compile the project.

The syntax is both easier to read than `make`'s Makefile, and more flexible.
